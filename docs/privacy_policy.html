        <h1>Image Compositor Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
        The Image Compositor program (IC, for short) can load your personal photos into its memory for the purpose of composition, but it does so under no other pretense.  In other words, IC will not (and cannot) send your photos to any other machine.  IC loads your photos into memory, works with them there, lets you save them out to disk in a composed form (if desired), and that is it.  It does not do any network communication of any kind.
